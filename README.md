# Description

This is a front-end React application which connects to the backend API & database (link above).

'Inclusive Manchester' is an app built for users who require additional accessibility needs, such as understanding what wheelchair access looks like in venues around Manchester City Center. It allows a community of users to contribute ratings, and comments about specific venues regarding how accessible the venue is, how equal they were made to feel there, and the attitudes of the staff and clientele at the location. It also allows an upvoting mechanism for users to 'vote up' on comments made by other users to confirm if those comments are an accurate reflection of the venue.

Built using React.js, and styled with the React-Bootstrap UI kit. It uses the React-leaflet framework to display and interact with mapping technology.

There is a back-end API version of this app, which it connects to and interacts with the database, available at: https://inclusive-manc-be.onrender.com/api/

**NB: Render, the service that hosts the back-end spins down resources after a periods of inactivity. On first visit, please allow some time for Render to re-provision resources to the back-end.**
